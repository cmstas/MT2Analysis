comment: |
    Two related searches for phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM) are performed using events with hadronic jets and significant transverse momentum imbalance. The results are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016--2018 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb$^{-1}$. The first search is inclusive, based on signal regions defined by the hadronic energy in the event, the jet multiplicity, the number of jets identified as originating from bottom quarks, and the value of the kinematic variable $M_\mathrm{T2}$ for events with at least two jets. For events with exactly one jet, the transverse momentum of the jet is used instead. The second search looks in addition for disappearing tracks produced by BSM long-lived charged particles that decay within the volume of the tracking detector. No excess event yield is observed above the predicted standard model background. This is used to constrain a range of BSM models that predict the following: the pair production of gluinos and squarks in the context of supersymmetry models conserving $R$-parity, with or without intermediate long-lived charginos produced in the decay chain; the resonant production of a colored scalar state decaying to a massive Dirac fermion and a quark; or the pair production of scalar and vector leptoquarks each decaying to a neutrino and a top, bottom, or light-flavor quark. In most of the cases, the results obtained are the most stringent constraints to date.

    Definitions of super signal regions, along with predictions, observed data, and the observed 95% CL upper limits on the number of signal events contributing to  each region ($N_{95}^\mathrm{max}$). The limits are given under assumptions of 0% and 15% for the uncertainty on the signal acceptance. All selection criteria as in the full analysis are applied. For regions with $N_\mathrm{j}=1$, $H_\mathrm{T}\equiv p_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{jet}$.

    Exclusion limits at 95% CL for direct light squark pair production, where the squarks decay to light-flavor quarks and either the lightest neutralino, or the lightest chargino, and the chargino is long-lived with $c\tau_0 = 200$ cm and mass O(100) MeV greater than the neutralino's mass. Signal cross sections are calculated at approximately NNLO+NNLL order in $\alpha_S$, for a single light squark.

    The maximum chargino mass excluded at 95% CL for direct gluino pair production, where the gluinos decay to light-flavor quarks and either the lightest neutralino, or the lightest chargino, and the chargino mass is O(100) MeV greater than the neutralino's mass. The chargino's lifetime is varied from $c\tau_{0} = 1$ to 2000 cm while the gluino mass is fixed to 1900 GeV. Signal cross sections are calculated at approximately NNLO+NNLL order in $\alpha_S$. If all kinematically allowed chargino masses are excluded, the curves, including 68 and 95% expected, tend to overlap. At short decay lengths, horizontal exclusion lines are obtained from the inclusive analysis, as this is not affected by track reconstruction inefficiencies, which may arise when the chargino decays before the CMS tracker, and therefore shows better sensitivity to scenarios with very small lifetime compared to the disappearing track search, based on median expected limits.
